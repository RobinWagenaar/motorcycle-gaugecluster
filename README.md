# SV650 Digital Gauges

## Project description
This repo contains all resources that I've used to make a gauge cluster for a first generation Suzuki SV650 (1999-2002). Everything from wiring loom schematics, diagrams of my custom arduino "shield", the software that I run on it, the components and connectors that I've used, bitmap-icons, 3D-models of the case (for 3D-printing), etc. Basically all information that might be useful to others in some way.

For recent changes and current status of the project, please check [this changelog](CHANGEBLOG.md).
